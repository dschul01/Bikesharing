Utilize Tableau to provide visualizations and analysis on a bike sharing program in New York City.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to utilize Tableau to provide investors a view into how the CitiBike share program works in New York City in order to implement a simliar model in Des Moines, IA.  Trip data from the CitiBike program collected during Aug'19 is the source behind the visualizations for this project.  Summer data is used as it likely contains the most data due to pleasant weather to entice locals to bike as well as tourists.  The Tableau story 
provides multiple charts which answers multiple questions investors would have when taking on such an adventure.  Details behind the story charts are seen in the [Results](##Results) section.
