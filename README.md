# Bikesharing
Utilize Tableau to provide visualizations and analysis on a bike sharing program in New York City.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to utilize Tableau to provide investors a view into how the CitiBike share program works in New York City in order to implement a simliar model in Des Moines, IA.  Trip data from the CitiBike program collected during Aug'19 is the source behind the visualizations for this project.  Summer data is used as it likely contains the most data due to pleasant weather to entice locals to bike as well as tourists.  The Tableau story 
provides multiple charts which answer multiple questions investors would have when taking on such a venture.  Details behind the story charts are seen in the [Results](#Results) section.

##  Results <a name="Results"></a>

The decision to initiate a bike sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa was based on analysis from the NYC CitiBike program.  The visualizations and analysis can be viewed within [my Bike Analysis Tableau story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/david.b.schultz/viz/Bike_Challenge_16647409152970/BikeSharinginNYC).  Screenshots are also provided below highlighting key metrics.

Majority of ride times per user are between 1 - 20 minutes with a nominal percentage of rentals lasting over 40 minutes.

Ride time behaviors are similar across all genders but we do see males utilizing the bikes significantly more than females.

Bike utilization mainly occurs between 7 - 10 a.m. and 5 - 7 p.m. on weekdays and 10 a.m. - 7 p.m. on weekends.  Wednesday's do show an anomoly in the latter part of the day which needs further research.

Bike utilization by hour and gender is similiar across the genders as we see in ride times by gender.

The Subscriber based model shows same trends on daily utilization as previous charts but also significantly higher utilization for male 'Subscribers'.  A subscriber model should be reviewed for consideration to implement in Des Moines.

Most bikes are utilized less than 8 times a day.  This should be considered when forecasting repair costs and bike placement throughout a month.  Consider rotating lower utilized bikes with those used more to allow a longer bike life.

![August%20Peak%20Hours.png](https://github.com/dschul01/Bikesharing/blob/main/Images/August%20Peak%20Hours.png)

Peak hours chart show 2 - 5 a.m. is the window with least usage.  This would be the recommended timeframe to repair and rotate bikes around the city. 

## Summary
There should be additional analysis on financial data before moving forward with the Des Moines Bike Sharing program.  However, NYC does show a significant volume of casual and subcription users utilizing the service.  Two additional visualizations suggested would be to look at ...................
